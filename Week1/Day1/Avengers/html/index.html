            Thor Odinson, more commonly known as Thor, and sometimes by his title as the God of Thunder, is a fictional character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on<br>
            the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse mythological god of the same name. In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the most powerful Asgardians, an ancient alien civilization with long ties to Earth, <br>
            humans consider to be gods. Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, and is initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the Nine Realms under Asgard's<br>protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted brother, Loki. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and becomes a founding member of the Avengers. Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard<br>
            after Odin's death, but the entire realm is destroyed during Ragnar√∂k. Following the Blip, he passes the crown of New Asgard<br> to Valkyrie and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.
